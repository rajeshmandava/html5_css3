        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
        describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
        such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
        XHTML)
      </li>
      <li>
        CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
        and JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the separation of
        presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts
      </li>
      <li>
        This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more
        flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
        characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
        specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces
        complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css
        file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that
        share the file and its formatting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present
        the same markup page in different styles for different rendering
        methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
        or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has
        rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile
        device
      </li>
      <li>
        The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine
        which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular
        element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable. The CSS
        specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
        Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS
        by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service
        for CSS documents.
